I wanted to try some js animations. First, default, animation will be rain.
It would be cool to do rain of bananas. 
Most buttons don't work yet. Only enter your file
Use small images. Text, transparent logo ...
- Technology Stack
Plain js, css and html. Runs on Node.js. Canvas
- Roadmap
I will better this with some other animations options, 
change background button, 
change motion direction and speed,
Change amount of images ...
